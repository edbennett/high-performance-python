In this lesson, you will learn how to make your software written in
Python go faster, both on your own desktop and on high-performance
supercompters.

> ## Prior knowledge
>
> This lesson assumes some familiarity with programming Python, and
> with using high-performance computers. If you haven't used these
> before, we would recommend working through the [Programming in
> Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation)
> and [Supercomputing Wales](https://edbennett.github.io/SCW-tutorial)
> tutorials.
